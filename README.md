# Monty hall problem - simulation

A simulation written in nodejs, demonstrate the probability of success when selecting the alternative door.

Game theory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem
Expected result (based on the theory): 
- probability when players don't change their selection: 1/3
- probability when players change their selection: 2/3

### Run the simulation

```sh
$ node run-simulation.js
```

### Run unit testing

Using Mocha.js (https://mochajs.org) javascript test framework (already included in this solution):
